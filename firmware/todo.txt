Exposure Timer MkII TODO:

[x] put in brightness adjustment.

[x] display remaining exposure count.
 [x] option 1: press Select to toggle, like the BF currently does.
 [n] option 2: be a geek, and display counts < 16 in binary on the DP leds. :)
  -> tried it; it's really not that readable.
 [x] option 3: display the count on the left side during the 10-second countdown
     to the next exposure!

[x] ability to save settings in eeprom.
 [x] brightness
 [ ] ???

[x] use idle mode--no busy loops.

[x] save power by eliminating leading zeroes. :D

[x] fix the sleep code; counting sleeps does not really work
    because we don't know that the MCU will actually get to sleep
    between every interrupt.

[x] eliminate state-change latency in auto state changes

[?] see if we can't get rid of that nasty flicker on startup.
  -> maybe initializing the frame buffer would help. :P
   -> you'd think...

[ ] clean up code a bit...
 [x] make symbolic names for all display digits
 [ ] be consistent in '\xZZ' use (and see if it saves us anything)

[x] double-buffer the display to prevent flicker.
  -> will transfer to the frame buffer with interrupts disabled.
   -> actually, I'm skeptical here.  we only draw one character per interrupt.
      so we can have partial displays either way.  so long as I'm drawing the
      display in a spatially localized way, this might not matter.
  --> so I think fixing interrupt priority, increasing the prescaler to 1/64
      and bumping the CPU speed to 2MHz solved the display glitches

[ ] power save mode...
 [x] put MCU in power save mode after idle timeout
   [x] wake up MCU by pushing a button. :D
 [ ] dim and/or turn off LEDs during long exposure?
   -> can currently do this manually...
 [x] soft power off

[ ] real-time clock mode.  depends on power-save mode above.

[x] battery voltage meter
  [ ] better place to *put* the battery voltage meter

[ ] fix encoder ISR "backlash" (where it fails to detect a change
    in direction without an extra click, sometimes)

[x] fix a CCW twist going "down" from an inferred stop to the same
    number we are currently staring at :P

[ ] come up with temperature calibration??

[x] wake up mode, with the half-press line
