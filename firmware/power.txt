measured power consumption  @ 3V

counting / idle

4 digits
b1 = 0.6mA / 0.5mA
b2 = 1.1mA / 1.0mA
b3 = 3.0mA / 2.9mA
b4 = 8.4mA / 8.3mA

2 digits
b1 = 0.5mA / 0.4mA
b2 = 0.8mA / 0.7mA
b3 = 1.7mA / 1.6mA
b4 = 4.5mA / 4.4mA

Counting power consumption was reduced to 0.1mA over idle power consumption
by trading the optoisolator for an NPN transistor with a 22k base resistor.
I probably could have made the base resistor much larger, but this seems fine.

Since the highest brightness level is retina-scorching at night (and the lowest
is perfectly serviceable), we really are looking at less than a milliamp of
average current draw. Meaning my pair of AAAs should _theoretically_ provide
on the order of 1000 hours of use. I'm probably not gonna get that in a _year_.


If we run at 8MHz--which eliminates the display glitches and allows a greater
brightness range to be used:

4 digits
b1 = 1.2mA / 1.1mA
b2 = 1.8mA / 1.7mA
b3 = 3.5mA / 3.4mA
b4 = 8.4mA / 8.2mA

... so it's a bit over half a milliamp penalty.

shutting some things down with the PRR:

b1 = 1.0mA / 0.9mA
b2 = 1.5mA / 1.4mA
b3 = 3.3mA / 3.1mA
b4 = 8.2mA / 8.0mA

the PRR gave no measurable savings at 1MHz, but shaved a third of a milliamp
off power consumption at 8MHz

still, on the balance I think I prefer staying at 1MHz for now.

(could we run at 2 or 4MHz? problem is there isn't a timer0 prescaler
between 1/8 and 1/64)
