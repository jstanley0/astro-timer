measured power consumption  @ 3V

counting / idle

4 digits
b1 = 0.6mA / 0.5mA
b2 = 1.1mA / 1.0mA
b3 = 3.0mA / 2.9mA
b4 = 8.4mA / 8.3mA

2 digits
b1 = 0.5mA / 0.4mA
b2 = 0.8mA / 0.7mA
b3 = 1.7mA / 1.6mA
b4 = 4.5mA / 4.4mA

Counting power consumption was reduced to 0.1mA over idle power consumption
by trading the optoisolator for an NPN transistor with a 22k base resistor.
I probably could have made the base resistor much larger, but this seems fine.

Since the highest brightness level is retina-scorching at night (and the lowest
is perfectly serviceable), we really are looking at less than a milliamp of
average current draw. Meaning my pair of AAAs should _theoretically_ provide
on the order of 1000 hours of use. I'm probably not gonna get that in a _year_.
